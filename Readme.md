    Colour Shifting          [████████  ]
	Background Image Loading [█████████ ]
	Quote Processing		 [██████████]

**v0.9 - Github Wubwub**

- You can load images from a "backgrounds" page, though the number of files must be manually entered into background.js
- Links will show up with associated images from the "icons" folder. Icons must be a PNG with the same name as the link.
- Quotes are formatted with markdown, where positive reinforcement is bold, and negative reinforcement is italics.

##Tech##
Uses jQuery, which is linked via Google's hosted libraries. Also uses:
